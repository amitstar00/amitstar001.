<h2  >Hey this is Amit Dubey from Kolkata India</h2>
<p>I have completed my BTECH in COMPUTER ENGINEERING from WBUT University<br>
I have also completed my DIPLOMA in COMPUTER ENGINEERING from THAKUR POLYTECHNIC(MSBTE) Mumbai the city of dreams
I have spent whole childhood in Mumbai it's one of the best city in India where every one come from different part of india to dream high 
and become successfull<br>
My passion was to become a cricketer but also i was in love with my computer i was crazy to know how this stuff is working so i opened and see what is there inside
<br>
but situation is not always same i have completed my Engineering but i was poor to code. The truth i always left the basic ones and go to advance for shortcut to become success but now in edwisor i start from basic now i can ya little bit i am slow but you know na...slow in steady wins the race(hahah)!!
<br>
